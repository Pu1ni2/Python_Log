Certainly! Here's a suggested workout plan and backout plan for revoking access for users in Informatica Intelligent Cloud Services (IICS) production environment:

Workout Plan:
1. Identify the users who need their access revoked in the IICS production environment. This could be based on their role changes, employment termination, or any other relevant factors.
2. Review the access privileges and permissions of the identified users to ensure accuracy and completeness.
3. Prepare a comprehensive list of the access rights and permissions that need to be revoked for each user.
4. Communicate with the stakeholders, such as supervisors or managers, to inform them about the access revocation for their respective team members.
5. Create a Change Request (CRQ) in the IICS production environment's change management system. Include the details of the users, their access rights, and the reason for revoking the access.
6. Coordinate with the appropriate teams, such as the security team or system administrators, to execute the access revocation for the identified users.
7. Monitor the access revocation process to ensure it is completed successfully and without any unintended impact.
8. Communicate with the stakeholders and affected users, informing them about the successful completion of the access revocation process.

Backout Plan:
1. In case any issues or unintended consequences arise during the access revocation process, immediately halt the further execution of access revocation steps.
2. Communicate the issue to the relevant stakeholders and the affected users, explaining the reason for the backout.
3. Identify the root cause of the issue and take necessary steps to address it promptly.
4. If possible, roll back the access revocation changes for the affected users to restore their previous access rights and permissions.
5. Conduct a thorough investigation to understand the cause of the issue and prevent similar problems in the future.
6. Update the change management system or documentation to record the backout process and its outcome.
7. Communicate with the stakeholders and affected users, informing them about the backout process, the reason for the issue, and any necessary follow-up actions.

Remember, it is essential to follow your organization's specific change management procedures and involve the appropriate teams and stakeholders throughout the process.
