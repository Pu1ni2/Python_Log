Certainly! I can help you with the general information, test plan, implementation plan, and backout plan for revoking access for users in IICS (Informatica Intelligent Cloud Services) Production (Prod). Please note that the following information is a general template, and you should tailor it according to your specific environment and requirements.

1. General Information:
   - CRQ Title/Summary: Revoking Access for Users in IICS Prod
   - CRQ ID/Number: [Auto-generated]
   - Requestor: [Your Name]
   - Date/Time of Request: [Current Date and Time]
   - Target Environment: IICS Production (Prod)
   - Change Type: Access Management
   - Change Description: This change request aims to revoke access for specific users in the IICS Prod environment in order to align with security and access control policies.

2. Test Plan:
   - Objective: To verify that the user access revocation process is successfully executed without any adverse impact on the IICS Prod environment.
   - Test Scenarios:
     - Scenario 1: Revoking access for individual user accounts
     - Scenario 2: Revoking access for user groups/roles
   - Test Steps:
     1. Identify the list of user accounts, groups, or roles that need access revocation.
     2. Execute the access revocation process for each identified user or group.
     3. Verify that the revoked users can no longer access the IICS Prod environment.
     4. Validate that other users and system functionality remain unaffected.
   - Test Environment: A non-production environment, such as IICS Sandbox or Test environment, should be used for testing.
   - Test Schedule: [Specify the planned dates and times for testing]
   - Test Resources: [List any additional resources or tools required for testing]

3. Implementation Plan:
   - Pre-Implementation Steps:
     - Notify affected users and stakeholders about the planned access revocation.
     - Communicate the maintenance window and potential impact to the relevant teams.
     - Ensure that a backup of user access permissions and configurations is taken for reference if needed.
   - Implementation Steps:
     1. Log in to the IICS Prod environment using appropriate administrative credentials.
     2. Navigate to the user management or access control section.
     3. Identify the users or groups whose access needs to be revoked.
     4. Follow the necessary steps within the IICS platform to disable or remove the user accounts or adjust access permissions accordingly.
     5. Document any changes made during the implementation process for future reference.
   - Post-Implementation Steps:
     - Verify that the access revocation has been successfully implemented.
     - Perform post-implementation testing to validate the revocation.
     - Update relevant documentation and access management records.

4. Backout Plan:
   - In the event of any unexpected issues or adverse impacts, it's important to have a backout plan in place to revert the changes made during the implementation. The backout plan may include:
     - Taking a backup of the current system state, including user access configurations.
     - Identifying the specific steps to reverse the changes made during implementation.
     - Communicating the backout plan to the relevant stakeholders.
     - Executing the backout plan in a timely manner if required.
     - Performing additional testing to ensure the environment is back to the pre-change state.
     - Documenting the backout process and any lessons learned for future reference.

Remember to involve the necessary teams, such as security, operations, and change management, in reviewing and approving the change request before proceeding with implementation. Additionally, adhere to your organization's change management processes and procedures to ensure a smooth and controlled change deployment.
